# MerdekaBle10b

The goal of this project is to develop an android application which detects other smartphones with the application active via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology 
and perform a coordinated action, which is playing the sound snippet “Merdeka!” in unison. This action is to be performed when there is more than one devices with our app
intalled. The time to play the sound is decided by the application. The list of devices detected is stored in an online database.

Even though the current implementation of this concept serves little purpose, the concept can be used for more useful purposes such as social distancing and contact 
tracing. This implementation follows a peer-to-peer like network, so two devices do not necessarily need to be within range of each other as long as there is a common 
device in between them.
